You are analyzing a conversation between a user and a travel assistant. Your goal is to identify the distinct tasks mentioned by the user and classify them using a label from the predefined taxonomy.

Each task should be returned as a JSON object with the following fields:
- in_scope: true if the task is a question about a specific tourist activity, false otherwise.
- label: a generic label that best fits the task, based on the taxonomy provided below. If no match is found, use "Otras".
- value: one of "solved", "partially_solved", or "not_solved", depending on whether the assistant resolved the task.

Here is the taxonomy:

{intents_json}

Here is the conversation payload:

{conversation_json}

Return ONLY the resulting tasks as a JSON array. Do not include any explanation, headings, or Markdown formatting.
